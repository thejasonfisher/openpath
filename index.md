#### What is it?
It's an automated, very simple path finding package for Unity. It's based on A* and written in UnityScript and C#. I am doing this in tandem with our Deus Ex themed game The Vongott Chronicles

#### How to use it?
Refer to the example project for a demonstration. You can select the map type in the "Scanner" object, and then activate the corresponding object (NavMeshTest, WayPointTest or GridTest).

#### WARNING!
For reasons unbeknownst to me, when you select an object with the OPPathFinder component on it, and the Unity Inspector is visible, there is a huge memory leak in Unity, causing the whole environment to come to a crawl. Select any other object in the scene (or unfocus/disable the inspector temporarily) and it's fine.

#### Features:
- Automatic world bounds calculation
- Raycast scanning and node placement
- Easily adjustable scanning parameters
- Multithreading
- Waypoint, grid and NavMesh based types
- Free & open source!
